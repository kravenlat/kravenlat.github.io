Sure! Here's a rewritten version of the article **“Shopify CEO says staffers need to prove jobs can’t be done by AI before asking for more headcount”** in an engaging, professional tone similar to the Llama 4 rewrite, expanded and enhanced for clarity and depth (approx. 1000+ words):

In an era where artificial intelligence is becoming an increasingly integral part of daily operations, **Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke** is doubling down on the company’s commitment to AI-driven efficiency — and making it crystal clear that old hiring habits no longer apply.

In a recent internal memo — which Lütke later made public on X — the Shopify founder told employees they must **demonstrate that their goals cannot be accomplished using AI tools** before requesting additional staffing or resources.

The message was direct: "What would this area look like if autonomous AI agents were already part of the team?" he wrote. The rhetorical question serves as both a thought experiment and a practical challenge for Shopify teams to rethink how work is assigned, optimized, and scaled in an AI-native environment.

### AI: From Enhancement to Expectation

While many tech companies are just beginning to experiment with AI integration, Shopify is **raising the bar**, pushing its workforce to fully embrace AI as a foundational productivity multiplier — not an optional enhancement.

“There’s now a **fundamental expectation** at Shopify that employees are integrating AI into their daily workflows,” Lütke said. “I’ve seen many of these people approach implausible tasks — ones we wouldn’t even have chosen to tackle before — with reflexive and brilliant usage of AI to get 100X the work done.”

This is not just lip service. The use of AI tools will now be **factored into performance reviews**, making it a core metric in evaluating employee output and impact. Shopify, which provides e-commerce infrastructure and tools to online merchants, views AI not merely as a support technology but as a **core competency** required for growth and innovation.

### Shopify's Internal AI Ecosystem

Shopify has already been weaving AI into the fabric of its operations. The company’s AI assistant, **Sidekick**, introduced last year, helps merchants navigate the platform, generate content, and automate customer service. In tandem, **Shopify Magic**, the brand’s broader suite of automation tools, allows users to streamline storefront tasks like product descriptions, email campaigns, and marketing workflows.

This isn’t just about flashy new features. It’s about shifting the company’s entire **operational philosophy** — from a people-driven model to a hybrid human-machine collaboration environment.

The message from the top is clear: before considering expanding your team, ask yourself what AI can do first.

### Aligning With Broader Tech Trends

Shopify’s AI-centric stance is part of a larger trend unfolding across the tech industry. As major players such as Microsoft, Google, Meta, and Amazon **pour hundreds of billions into AI research and infrastructure**, there’s a growing realization that leaner, smarter teams can often outperform traditional, labor-heavy structures.

And while AI spending is surging, so are layoffs. According to Layoffs.fyi, **over 152,000 tech jobs were eliminated across 549 companies** in 2024 alone. Shopify, too, has followed this trajectory — downsizing by 14% in 2022 and another 20% in 2023. Its current headcount sits at around **8,100 employees**, down from 8,300 a year earlier.

At a recent Morgan Stanley investor event, **Shopify CFO Jeff Hoffmeister** emphasized the company's cautious approach to workforce growth. “We can keep headcount relatively flat,” he said, noting that **compensation may rise** due to increased demand for **high-caliber AI talent**. One “high-end AI engineer,” he added, might contribute significantly more than multiple junior hires, though their compensation may be disproportionately higher.

### A Culture Shift in the Making

What Shopify is doing isn’t just policy — it’s **culture engineering**. By reframing headcount requests through an AI-first lens, the company is encouraging employees to think more like technologists and automation architects than traditional knowledge workers.

The implications are broad:

- **Product managers** must now design with automation in mind.
- **Support teams** are expected to partner with AI agents instead of duplicating manual processes.
- **Marketers and content teams** must harness generative tools before submitting copywriting briefs.

In short, Shopify is making AI literacy and proactive usage a **prerequisite for strategic thinking**, not just a skill set reserved for engineers.

### Empowerment or Pressure?

Naturally, such a bold shift raises questions about employee morale, job security, and inclusivity. While Lütke frames the policy as an invitation to "fun discussions and projects," it could also be perceived as pressure — especially for those in non-technical roles or individuals less familiar with AI tools.

But to Lütke and the leadership team, the benefits outweigh the risks. Employees who fully engage with AI, he argued, are unlocking **10 to 100 times** more productivity. For a tech company striving to remain competitive in a post-pandemic world, that kind of exponential output isn't just nice to have — it's essential.

### The Bigger Picture: AI as a Strategic Filter

From a business strategy perspective, this directive effectively turns **AI into a gatekeeper** — a strategic filter through which all resourcing decisions must pass. By requiring employees to first attempt AI-enabled solutions, Shopify ensures that only the most essential, non-automatable roles are filled.

This approach mirrors a growing philosophy in executive circles: **AI doesn't just change how we work; it changes what we consider “work” at all.**

Why hire more people to perform manual analysis when AI can generate insights in seconds? Why draft repetitive content when a well-prompted LLM can do it in milliseconds?

### The Future of Work – Starting at Shopify

Shopify’s move may foreshadow broader shifts across industries. As tools like **GPT-4**, **Claude 3**, and **open-source LLMs** become more powerful and widely accessible, companies in finance, healthcare, media, and education will likely adopt similar AI-first frameworks.

For now, Shopify is one of the clearest examples of a company placing **AI at the center of workforce strategy**, not just in product development.

Will others follow?

Given the rising costs of human capital and the relentless pace of AI innovation, the answer is almost certainly yes.

### Conclusion: Build With AI or Be Replaced By It

Shopify’s new mandate may sound provocative, but it’s grounded in pragmatism. In an AI-native economy, **talent won’t just be measured by how much it can do — but by how well it leverages AI to do even more**.

Tobi Lütke’s message to his teams isn’t a warning. It’s a vision: one where human creativity and machine intelligence fuse to form an unstoppable force — and where headcount only grows when the machine can’t take the lead.
