The **Lightning Spear Huntress** is an endgame-capable build centered around massive screen-clearing potential and smooth, fast-paced gameplay. It's especially great if you like flashy effects, high crits, and *not spamming multiple buttons to win*. 

> 💬 *"If you liked Twister, this is a natural next step—plus, it can handle T15s with barely any gear."*

## 🎮 Playstyle

### Map Clearing – Easy & Flashy
- **Main Skill:** *Lightning Spear*
- **Mechanic:** Move around to build **Vault charges** (up to 30), then cast Lightning Spear to unleash destruction.
- **Important Tip:** Don’t spam the skill—**move between casts** to get the full 30-stack effect for maximum damage.

### Bossing – Focused & Strategic
- Use **Sniper Mark** on the boss.
- Spam **Storm Lance**. When you crit with it, it consumes Sniper Mark and **auto-detonates the next Lance** for huge damage.
- Reapply Sniper Mark and repeat.
- Optional: You *can* just use Lightning Spear + Sniper Mark for bosses if you prefer a simpler loop—just expect a damage drop.

## 🔋 Leveling Tips

You *can* level as Lightning Spear, but it doesn’t feel amazing until later. Consider leveling with **Twister**, then transition.

- **Early Passive Focus:** Accuracy + Elemental Damage
- **Priority Nodes:** Head toward **Spear clusters** and **Electrocution nodes**
- **Key Milestones:**
  - **Combat Frenzy** passive (Frenzy charge on freeze/electrocute/pin every 4.4s)
  - **Koko’s Current Gloves** for reliable electrocution

> 🆕 A skill called **"Strike"** might help with charge generation soon!

---

## 🔚 Endgame Power (T15 Capable)

- Clears hardest content in the game.
- Very low investment: under **3 Divines**.
- Didn’t even require a 6-link or 4th ascendancy to get there.

---

## 🛡️ Gear Priorities

### 🗡️ Weapon
- High **accuracy**
- High **crit chance**
- Added **phys/lightning damage**
- **Sealass** spear base is best-in-slot

### 🧤 Gloves
- **Koko’s Current Jeweled Gloves** – borderline mandatory
  - Enables electrocution to trigger frenzy generation

### 🛡️ Shield
- Unique with **double accuracy rating** is great, but rare
- A solid rare shield will do just fine

### 🪖 Helmet, Armor, Boots
- **Evasion or hybrid ES/Evasion**
- Prioritize:
  - Life
  - Resistances
  - Spirit (on body)
  - Movement Speed (on boots)

### 💍 Rings & Amulet
- Look for:
  - Flat lightning/physical damage
  - Accuracy
  - Crit chance
  - Projectile skills
  - Life and resists
  - Dexterity!

> 💡 This build is **attribute-heavy** – don’t neglect Dex, Int, and Strength on gear!

---

## 🏹 Amazon Huntress Ascendancy

1. **Overcap Crit via Accuracy:**  
   Crit chance can exceed 100%, and ¼ of excess accuracy turns into more crit chance. Stack that accuracy!
2. **Accuracy = Flat Physical Damage**
3. **Elemental Infusion** – boosts elemental damage
4. **Predatory Instinct** – better than the alternate node on the same tree

---

## 🌲 Passive Tree Guide

- Start with **Accuracy**, **Elemental**, and **Dex nodes**
- Move into:
  - **Spear Nodes** – amazing boosts to projectiles, crits, and attack speed
  - **Falcon Dive** – attack speed per accuracy
  - **Herald Buffs** – synergy with Herald of Thunder
  - **Crit + Charge Nodes**
  - **Lightning Penetration**
  - Eventually, add **defensive layers** like block (aim for ~72–73%)

> 🔍 Check out *Fub Gun’s Atlas tree* for an optimized endgame farming route.

- Consider **Tame Beast** as your companion for smoother utility
