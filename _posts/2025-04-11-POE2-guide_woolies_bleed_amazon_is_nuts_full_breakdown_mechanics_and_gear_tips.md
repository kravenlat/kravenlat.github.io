#[Guide] Woolie’s Bleed Amazon is NUTS – Full Breakdown, Mechanics, and Gear Tips

## 🩸 **Bleed Amazon Build Guide (Woolie-style)**
*For those who love agile playstyles, damage over time, and dancing around enemies like a whirlwind of blades and blood.*

---

### 🧠 **Core Concept: Bleed, Bounce, and Burst**

This build is all about inflicting **Bleed**, a physical damage-over-time effect, and then stacking on hit damage when the time is right. You’ll *dash in*, *dash out*, and *punish enemies* while they’re hemorrhaging. The vibe? Think “elegant predator.”

#### 🎯 Single-Target Dance: **Rake** + **Disengage**

- **Rake** is your main event: a dash-attack that *always* inflicts bleed. It deals **more damage the farther you travel**, so distance = damage.
- **Disengage** is your setup move. Dash backwards to **create distance**, setting up another long-range Rake for even more bleed burst.
- The loop? **Rake → Disengage → Rake → Disengage**. You’re basically a yo-yo of death.

Once you’ve stacked enough Bleed (watch for that red overlay on the health bar), it’s time for your **big finisher**:

- **Blood Hunt** – It **executes** the enemy, dealing not just big hit damage, but a % of the total **bleed they've already taken**. It's brutal, and super satisfying to land.

---

### 🌪️ Group Clear: **Double Spearfield Setup**

You have **two flavors** of Spearfield, both awesome for different reasons:

1. **Clearing Spearfield** – Focuses on AoE bleed application and explosive death chains.
   - Linked with: *Lacerate*, *Splinter*, *Tear*, *Rearm*
   - Works with **Herald of Blood** to cause bleeding enemies to **explode on death**, triggering wild chain reactions. It's bloody chaos in the best way.

2. **Rage Spearfield** – Buffs your bleed damage, improves crits, and debuffs enemies.
   - Linked with: *Rage*, *Blood in the Eyes*, *Perfectly Placed Knife*
   - Applies *hobble* (lowers evasion), *blind*, and even **doubles your bleed** on crits. Great for both packs and tougher enemies.

### 🌟 Amazon Ascendency – Critical to Success

You're going deep into the **Amazon's Critical Strikes and Penetrate nodes**:

- **Critical Strikes** – Converts overcapped **accuracy into crit chance**, so stack that accuracy hard.
- **Penetrate** – The MVP node. Grants flat **global physical damage** based on your weapon’s accuracy. Woolie found that unallocating this cost him **43% of his DPS**. That’s not a typo.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Your weapon's base damage doesn't matter much – its **accuracy rating** is what matters. That’s your real DPS stat.

### 🔗 Skill Gem Links – The Engine of the Build

**Rake**
- *Deep Cuts* (bleed magnitude)
- *Heavy Swing* (more hit dmg)
- *Momentum* (bonus from movement)
- *Close Combat* (extra melee dmg)

**Disengage**
- *Impale* (stores dmg for next hit – this is nuts)
- *Ingenuity* (cooldown reduction)
- *Shocking Leap* (applies shock on crit)

**Blood Hunt**
- *Execute* (big finish)
- *Blood Lust* (consumes bleed for bonus dmg)
- *Conchk Effect* (enhanced hit dmg)

**Blood Hounds Mark**
- *Single Out* (armor shred – necessary because your hits are small without it)

**Rage Spearfield**
- *Rage*, *Blood in the Eyes*, *Perfectly Placed Knife*

**Clearing Spearfield + Herald of Blood Combo**
- *Lacerate*, *Splinter*, *Tear*, *Rearm*
- *Herald of Blood*, *Hemo Crystal Support*, *Brutality*, *Deadly Herald*

### 🛡️ Gear Goals – Survivability Meets Slaughter

**Defensively**: Focus on **Evasion** and **Life**.

**Weapon**: Go for one with **high flat accuracy**, even if its base DPS sucks. You're scaling off accuracy, not weapon damage.

**Key Unique**:
- **Venopuncture Ring** – Adds:
  - Bleed on hit
  - Bleed magnitude
  - Flat phys damage
  - Slows bleeding enemies (and you, unless you’re immune!)
- Use a **staunching charm** to avoid getting slowed yourself.

**Other Gear Tips**:
- Look for `+ levels to melee skills` on **amulets** and **chest armor**
- Aim for at least **+30 Spirit** to cover all your aura and active skill costs
- **Shield**: Pick one with **Armor + Evasion** base for higher block chance
- Consider **Glancing Blows** on tree for block cap (you take half damage when blocking)

## 🔥 Dual Wielding Tech – (Bonus from Carnarius)

This part isn't Amazon-specific, but it’s **must-know tech** for anyone looking to scale damage in PoE2.

### ⚔️ Dual Wielding Is Busted

- In PoE2, **both weapons deal damage at once**. You lose 30% per weapon, but hitting with **two at once** = **~40% more total damage** overall.
- It's like having **two free support gems** per skill.

### 💣 The OP Combo: Dual 2-Handers

- Use two-handed weapons with:
  - `+ Level to all melee skills` (up to +7!)
  - `Increased elemental damage with attacks` (up to 139%)
- The **mods stack** across both weapons. It's potentially **triple the damage** of a sword-and-board setup.

### 🧢 Gear Tips from Carnarius

- **Gloves**: Look for +2 to melee skills (+3 with corruption)
- **Rings**: Add flat **fire damage** (great early, or for fire builds)
- **Amulet**: **Z’s Blood** – budget-friendly, **permanent Fire Exposure** (–20% enemy resist!), and gives fire res. Big win for fire builds.
- **Run Avatar of Fire** once you get Z’s Blood. Then stack **fire pen** and burn everything.
- **Runes**: Dual 2H = **4 rune slots** total. Load up on **increased skill speed**, attack speed, or bleed scaling.

### 🛡️ Shield vs. Dual Wielding?

Shields = tanky, but the damage drop is steep. **Carnarius** says: If you’re not dying, always go **dual 2-handers**. The difference is night and day.

---

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This build isn’t just strong – it’s satisfying as hell. You’re constantly **moving**, **bleeding**, and **striking with precision**, which makes it one of the most *visceral* playstyles in PoE2 right now. Whether you’re clearing mobs or facing bosses, you’re in control of the tempo.

And with **Carnarius’** tech, there’s room to evolve it even further with dual wielding strats or hybrid fire-bleed setups.

Got questions? Want a gear planner or PoB template for this? I got you. Just let me know where you’re at.
